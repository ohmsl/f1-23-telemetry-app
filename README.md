This is an experimental dashboard intended to visualise an F1 car's telemetry, driven entirely by the UDP telemetry output of the F1 games. This was an experiment to see how react performed when pushing high frequency state updates and rerenders.

There are absolutely bottlenecks, it absolutely eats your system memory, and there are some very lazy programming practices that will make your eyes water. But, it works. 

Feel free to fork and experiment with it yourself.
